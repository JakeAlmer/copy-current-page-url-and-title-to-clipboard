Very simple Firefox extension to copy current page's title and url to clipboard. Modified version of https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/tree/main/context-menu-copy-link-with-types.

For example, instead of getting just `https://www.google.com` you'll get `<a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>`.

This handy for copying links into documents and emails where seeing the page title is more useful than long url with a massive query string.

I wanted something similar to the way Edge copies urls.
